# LAB: Rails API with Full CRUD

This lab is meant to build your skills in creating a full crud app that accesses your Rails API. This homework builds on your [rails-api-with-react-lab](https://git.generalassemb.ly/sei-nyc-cicadas/rails-api-with-react-lab) homework.

## DELIVERABLE:

Your goal in this assignment is to extend your REST-ful Rails API so that you can accomplish full CRUD functionality. You will:

- Build your Rails API so that it can create, read, update, and delete data.
- Connect to your API with a React frontend that applies full CRUD.
- Style your app.
- Deploye your new app (Rails API + React client) which now includes full CRUD functionality.

## Extending your current Rails API

1. Fork
2. Create a feature branch
3. Clone
4. Copy appropriate files from your [rails-api-with-react-lab](https://git.generalassemb.ly/sei-nyc-cicadas/rails-api-with-react-lab) homework into your cloned repo.
5. Install/update any necessary packages/gems into cloned repo.
6. Update your Rails controllers with any `before_action`.
7. Add routes for `create` , `update`, `destroy` to your current Rails API.

## Adding to React

Time to add the React Frontend to your Rails API.

1. Create
2. Make sure all dependencies installed in client folder.
3. Make routes to:
   - Display all students
   - Display one student
4. Make functionality that:
   - Updates one student
   - Deletes one student
   - Creates a new student
5. Style: **flex-box**, grid, third-party library, etc.
6. Bring it together -> **Deploy** your beautiful FULL CRUD student api and client!
